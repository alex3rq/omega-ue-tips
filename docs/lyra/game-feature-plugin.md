# Game Features Plugin

> Game Features allows developers to create **modular** and **plug-and-play content** for their games.

## Features

### Modular Content Creation

Instead of modifying the core game code, you can build functionalities as separate **plugins**. These plugins are self-contained units with their own assets, data, and logic.
This modular approach promotes cleaner code organization and easier maintenance, especially for large projects.

### Plug-and-Play Functionality

Game Features allows you to **enable or disable** these plugins at any time during development or even within the final game. This offers a high degree of flexibility.
You can add new features, gameplay mechanics, or even entire game modes without touching the core game code. This simplifies iteration and testing of new ideas.

## Benefits of Using Game Features

* **Improved Code Maintainability:** By separating functionalities into modules, the codebase becomes easier to understand, modify, and debug.
* **Faster Development:** New features can be developed and integrated into the game more efficiently.
* **Content Experimentation:** The ability to easily enable and disable features allows for quicker testing and iteration during development.
* **Potential for Marketplace Assets:** Developers can create and share Game Feature plugins as Marketplace assets, promoting reusability and collaboration within the Unreal Engine community.
