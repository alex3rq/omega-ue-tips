# Controller Component & Character Parts

> **Lyra Controller Component** is a part of the character customization system in Lyra.
>
> Controller Component plays a crucial role in determining which **Character Parts** are associated with a given Pawn.

**Lyra Controller Component works in conjunction with two other components:**

* **Character Parts:** These are the visual building blocks of your character, like heads, torsos, legs, and accessories. Lyra offers both pre-defined full body characters and a modular system where you can mix and match parts.
* **Pawn Component:** This component lives on both the server and all the clients in a multiplayer game. It receives instructions from the Controller Component (server-side) on which character parts to display and replicates that information to all players.

## Functionality features

* **Dynamic Selection:** The Controller Component dynamically selects the appropriate Character Parts based on the specific Pawn. This allows for flexibility and customization, ensuring that each Pawn can have a unique combination of parts.
* **Blueprint Integration:** In Lyra, the Controller Componentâ€™s logic is often implemented using Blueprint. This means that designers and developers can easily configure and adjust the Character Parts for different Pawns without diving into code.

## Create the Lyra Character Parts

> **Note:** For this example we are following Bastian Dev tutorial

1. Go to your plugin's `Characters` folder.
2. Right click and create a Blueprint based on the class `LyraControllercomponent_CharacterParts`.
3. Name it `BP_XX_CharParts`. *(Replace XX with your plugin initials)*
4. Open it and from `Begin Play` drag a node and search for `Add Character Part`
5. Right click on top of `New part` in the `Add character Part` function node and select `Split Struct Pin`.
